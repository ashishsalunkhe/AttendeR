# AttendeR
Android Application for QR-based attendance </br>
In this system, the attendance record and maintenance work is done on digital
platform. Initially, the students have to login through the AttendeR app to access the service
from their smartphones. After the lecture, the teacher have to generate a dynamic QR code
with the help of online web based service using their authorized login credentials and have to
project it on screen. After that, the students will scan the generated QR code using the camera
through the AttendeR app and their attendance for that particular lecture will be updated into
the database. So there is no need of maintaining or preserving any physical record for
attendance.
